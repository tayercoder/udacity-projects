# Udacity- Deep Learning Nanodegree Projects
1. Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns:
  In this project, I built and trained my own neural network from scratch and predicted the number of bikeshare user o a given day.
  
2. CNN: Project: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App
  Project Overview
  Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, we're going to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
  
3. Recurrent Neural Networks: Generate TV Scripts
  In this project, I generated my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs(LSTM).
