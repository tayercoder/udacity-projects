# Udacity- Deep Learning Nanodegree Projects
1. Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns:
  In this project, I built and trained my own neural network from scratch and predicted the number of bikeshare user o a given day.
  
2. CNN: Project: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App
  Project Overview
  Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, we're going to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
  
3. Recurrent Neural Networks: Generate TV Scripts
  In this project, I generated my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs(LSTM). 
  
4. Generative Adversarial Networks: Generate Faces
  In this project, I defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces and generated new faces.
 
5. Amazon Sagemaker: Deploying a Model
  In this project, I used Amazon Sagemaker service to train the neural network for sentiment analysis then deployed the model, after that used Lambda function to connect the service endpoint with trained model, then at the end used simple html page to send the review the endpoint and received the response correctly.
