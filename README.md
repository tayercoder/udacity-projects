# Udacity- Deep Learning and NLP Nanodegree Projects
1. Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns:
  In this project, I built and trained my own neural network from scratch and predicted the number of bikeshare user o a given day.
  
2. CNN: Project: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App
  Project Overview
  Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, we're going to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
  
3. Recurrent Neural Networks: Generate TV Scripts
  In this project, I generated my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs(LSTM). 
  
4. Generative Adversarial Networks: Generate Faces
  In this project, I defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces and generated new faces.
 
5. Amazon Sagemaker: Deploying a Model
  In this project, I used Amazon Sagemaker service to train the neural network for sentiment analysis then deployed the model, after that used Lambda function to connect the service endpoint with trained model, then at the end used simple html page to send the review the endpoint and received the response correctly.
  
6. AI Programming with Python - Developing an Image Classifier
  This project is the final project of the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree and in this project I accomplished a commandline application which can recognize different species of flowers.

7. Part of Speech Tagging with Hidden Markov Models (NLP)
  In this project, I used the Pomegranate library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging using a "universal" tagset. 
  
8. Machine Translation (NLP)
  In this project, I built a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. By using Keras and Encode - Decoder model, I reached very high accuracy. 
  
9. Speech Recognition with Neural Networks (NLP)
  In this project, I used Keras to implement diefferent types of models like RNN, Deep RNN, Biderectional RNN and CNN + RNN. At the end I combined CNN + Deep RNN trained my own solution and reached good result.
